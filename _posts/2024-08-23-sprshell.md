### A simply shell made in pure C.

## Basic lifetime of a shell
Let's look at a shell from the top down. A shell does three main things in its lifetime.

- **Iniatialize:** In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These changes aspects of the shell's behavior.
- **Interpret:** Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.
- **Terminate:** After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, free ups any memory, and terminates.

Our shell will be so simple that there won’t be any configuration files, and there won’t be any shutdown command. So, we’ll just call the looping function and then terminate.


```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Load config files, of any

    // Run command loop
    lsh_loop();

    // Perform any shutdown/cleanup

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

## Basic loop of a shell
So we’ve taken care of how the program should start up. Now, for the basic program logic: what does the shell do during its loop? Well, a simple way to handle commands is with three steps:

- **Read:** Read the command from standard input.
- **Parse:** Separate the command string into a program and arguments.
- **Execute:** Run the parsed command.

Here, I’ll translate those ideas into code for lsh_loop():


```c
void lsh_loop(void) {
    char *line;
    char **args;
    int status;

    do {
        printf("> ");
        line = lsh_read_line();
        args = lsh_split_line(line);
        status = lsh_execute(args);

        free(line);
        free(args);
    } while(status);
}
```

### Reading a line

Reading a line from stdin sounds so simple, but in C it can be a hassle. You can’t simply allocate a block and hope they don’t exceed it. Instead, you need to start with a block, and if they do exceed it, reallocate with more space.

```c
#define LSH_RL_BUFSIZE 1024
char *lsh_read_line(void)
{
  int bufsize = LSH_RL_BUFSIZE;
  int position = 0;
  char *buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * bufsize);
  int c;

  if (!buffer) {
    fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  while (1) {
    // Read a character
    c = getchar();

    // If we hit EOF, replace it with a null character and return.
    if (c == EOF || c == '\n') {
      buffer[position] = '\0';
      return buffer;
    } else {
      buffer[position] = c;
    }
    position++;

    // If we have exceeded the buffer, reallocate.
    if (position >= bufsize) {
      bufsize += LSH_RL_BUFSIZE;
      buffer = realloc(buffer, bufsize);
      if (!buffer) {
        fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The first part is a lot of declarations. The meat of the function is within the (apparently infinite) while (1) loop. In the loop, we read a character (and store it as an int, not a char, that’s important! EOF is an integer, not a character, and if you want to check for it, you need to use an int. This is a common beginner C mistake.). If it’s the newline, or EOF, we null terminate our current string and return it. Otherwise, we add the character to our existing string.

### Parsing the line

 Now, we need to parse that line into a list of arguments. I’m going to make a glaring simplification here, and say that we won’t allow quoting or backslash escaping in our command line arguments. Instead, we will simply use whitespace to separate arguments from each other. So the command echo *"this message"* would not call echo with a single argument this message, but rather it would call echo with two arguments: *"this* and *message"*.

 ```c
#define LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE 64
#define LSH_TOK_DELIM " \t\r\n\a"
char **lsh_split_line(char *line)
{
  int bufsize = LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE, position = 0;
  char **tokens = malloc(bufsize * sizeof(char*));
  char *token;

  if (!tokens) {
    fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  token = strtok(line, LSH_TOK_DELIM);
  while (token != NULL) {
    tokens[position] = token;
    position++;

    if (position >= bufsize) {
      bufsize += LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE;
      tokens = realloc(tokens, bufsize * sizeof(char*));
      if (!tokens) {
        fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
    }

    token = strtok(NULL, LSH_TOK_DELIM);
  }
  tokens[position] = NULL;
  return tokens;
}
```

If this code looks suspiciously similar to lsh_read_line(), it’s because it is! We are using the same strategy of having a buffer and dynamically expanding it. But this time, we’re doing it with a null-terminated array of pointers instead of a null-terminated array of characters.

At the start of the function, we begin tokenizing by calling strtok. It returns a pointer to the first token. What strtok() actually does is return pointers to within the string you give it, and place \0 bytes at the end of each token. We store each pointer in an array (buffer) of character pointers.

Finally, we reallocate the array of pointers if necessary. The process repeats until no token is returned by strtok, at which point we null-terminate the list of tokens.


### How shells start process

There are only two ways of starting processes on Unix. The first one (which almost doesn’t count) is by being Init. You see, when a Unix computer boots, its kernel is loaded. Once it is loaded and initialized, the kernel starts only one process, which is called Init. This process runs for the entire length of time that the computer is on, and it manages loading up the rest of the processes that you need for your computer to be useful.

Since most programs aren’t Init, that leaves only one practical way for processes to get started: the fork() system call. When this function is called, the operating system makes a duplicate of the process and starts them both running. The original process is called the “parent”, and the new one is called the “child”. fork() returns 0 to the child process, and it returns to the parent the process ID number (PID) of its child. In essence, this means that the only way for new processes is to start is by an existing one duplicating itself.

This might sound like a problem. Typically, when you want to run a new process, you don’t just want another copy of the same program – you want to run a different program. That’s what the exec() system call is all about. It replaces the current running program with an entirely new one. This means that when you call exec, the operating system stops your process, loads up the new program, and starts that one in its place. A process never returns from an exec() call (unless there’s an error).

With these two system calls, we have the building blocks for how most programs are run on Unix. First, an existing process forks itself into two separate ones. Then, the child uses exec() to replace itself with a new program. The parent process can continue doing other things, and it can even keep tabs on its children, using the system call wait().

 ```c
int lsh_launch(char **args)
{
  pid_t pid, wpid;
  int status;

  pid = fork();
  if (pid == 0) {
    // Child process
    if (execvp(args[0], args) == -1) {
      perror("lsh");
    }
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  } else if (pid < 0) {
    // Error forking
    perror("lsh");
  } else {
    // Parent process
    do {
      wpid = waitpid(pid, &status, WUNTRACED);
    } while (!WIFEXITED(status) && !WIFSIGNALED(status));
  }

  return 1;
}
```

This function takes the list of arguments that we created earlier. Then, it forks the process, and saves the return value. Once fork() returns, we actually have two processes running concurrently. The child process will take the first if condition (where pid == 0).

In the child process, we want to run the command given by the user. So, we use one of the many variants of the exec system call, execvp. The different variants of exec do slightly different things. Some take a variable number of string arguments. Others take a list of strings. Still others let you specify the environment that the process runs with. This particular variant expects a program name and an array (also called a vector, hence the ‘v’) of string arguments (the first one has to be the program name). The ‘p’ means that instead of providing the full file path of the program to run, we’re going to give its name, and let the operating system search for the program in the path.

If the exec command returns -1 (or actually, if it returns at all), we know there was an error. So, we use perror to print the system’s error message, along with our program name, so users know where the error came from. Then, we exit so that the shell can keep running.

The second condition (pid < 0) checks whether fork() had an error. If so, we print it and keep going – there’s no handling that error beyond telling the user and letting them decide if they need to quit.

The third condition means that fork() executed successfully. The parent process will land here. We know that the child is going to execute the process, so the parent needs to wait for the command to finish running. We use waitpid() to wait for the process’s state to change. Unfortunately, waitpid() has a lot of options (like exec()). Processes can change state in lots of ways, and not all of them mean that the process has ended. A process can either exit (normally, or with an error code), or it can be killed by a signal. So, we use the macros provided with waitpid() to wait until either the processes are exited or killed. Then, the function finally returns a 1, as a signal to the calling function that we should prompt for input again.


## Setup
To run the program automatically, run the setup.sh script (as root). The script will check if we have the necessary dependencies installed, and it will compile and run the program for us. 

>We must give it execution permissions if necessary:

```sh
$ chmod +x setup.sh
```

>And then run the script as root:

```sh
$ sudo setup.sh
```
